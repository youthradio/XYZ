topic description ,"The American political system is a drama that can keep anyone guessing -- and no, we’re not just talking about House Of Cards. Take a trip down the red, white and blue memory lane, and hear what a difference a decade can make.","Technology has become a defining part of our generational divides. Just think back on your first social media platform, cell phone model, video game console, or screen name. Chances are they’ll feel dated to people just a few years older/younger than you. Just give a listen to these stories about super specific moments in teen tech culture.  
","Establishing fashion trends is a rite of passage of every generation of teens. But when it comes to the clothes we actually wore back when we were young… well some things stood the test of time better than others. So break out the JNCO jeans and try on these vintage pieces from teens over the last ten years.
","Ever hear a teen talk and feel like they’re speaking a different language? Every generation (and region) establishes their own style of slang. Listening back on it, we have to ask ourselves. What the heck were we trying to say??","From music to media to gender pronouns, a lot has changed over the past decade. Yesterday’s “fringe” is tomorrow’s “mainstream.” We touch on a few important trends that have defined each generation’s understanding of who we are."
